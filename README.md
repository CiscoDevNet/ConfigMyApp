# ConfigMyApp

ConfigMyApp is a <b>Monitoring as Code</b> solution. ConfigMyApp declaratively configures AppDynamics business applications, Server Viz, dashboards, and more, without the need to manually login to the controller. 

ConfigMyApp enhances rapid rollout of AppDynamics. We built it based on the DevOps configuration-as-code paradigm with a simple objective â€“ the ability to configure AppDynamics from your Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) platform - such as Jenkins, Harness, Azure DevOps, TeamCity, GitLab, Bamboo, etc. In addition, ConfigMyApp can be executed from the <a href="https://appdynamics.github.io/ConfigMyApp/integrations/2-docker.html">`official Docker image`</a> and Kubernetes. 

Configuration as code allows the entire configurations to be stored as source code.  It moves the managing of certain configurations from the UI to the developer's integrated development environment. This approach brings a lot of benefits, and the like. versioning of changes, traceability of state changes, smooth promotion of config changes from test to production controller etc. 

ConfigMyApp saves time, hassle and cost, as it reduces human error and time-to-value while it maintains consistency of thresholds and naming conventions across your estate.  


ConfigMyApp is wrapper on supported AppDynamics RESTful APIs.
